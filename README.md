# Add_Shilder
In this branch we just add a zoom slider with map to control zoom value.<br>
To add slider <b>main.css</b> file added some <b>#map</b> tag. These tag only set the style of the slider.<br>
Working of the slider, controlled by <b>map.addControl(zoomslider);</b> function. In <b>main.js</b> file we add only two lines, one for variable declairation and another for control of the slider.
